   learning to code wasn't at the top of things I thought I would be interested in while in high school or college. When I was reintroduced to it a few months ago I felt something click, I really enjoyed learning, reading, writing and just about everything else. 

   After I graduated high school, I moved around a lot trying to find who I am, where I belong and what I want from my life. I went to college for three semesters and decided it wasn’t for me and I didn’t want to spend my time or my money on something that I wasn’t really interested in. I spent a long time trying to find something I could be proud of doing and that overall made me happy so, I went straight to a low paying warehouse job…
	
   I started trying new career paths utilizing different free trial programs and YouTube in dozens of different areas that wouldn’t require a lot college education to get into. About two years later, my best friend found http://www.flatironschool.com. With the free prep course and other online programs, I grew to love it. I am more than excited to start this journey feeling like I finally found something I’m truly interested in doing. Long nights of programming don’t scare me like a 10hr shift at a job I hate. The more I learn the more I grow, and that feeling isn’t what I was getting with other programs or job fields. I chose Software Engineering because I feel great doing it. I feel creative, inspired and that’s all I need to know this is where I want to be, this is where I belong.
