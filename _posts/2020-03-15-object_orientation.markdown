When I was first introduced to OOR (Object Oriented Ruby), I found myself struggling a lot. Being able to think and code using OOR was like trying to learn a new language inside of a language I'm already struggling to learn. Days were spent reading, watching hours of YouTube videos, drinking coffee and scratching my head before I came across Object Relations. Coding out relationships helped change my way of thinking and I started to visualize the way objects interact with each other.

These days so many processes happen in daily life that goes by unnoticed. For example, typing on a keyboard isn't as simple as pressing keys to output information, the position and functionality of the cursor need to be processed first, then the keyboard and output. My way of thinking was to simple to grasp this concept of real-world functionality and "training" objects to behave functionally was, and still is, difficult for me to map out. Thankfully, I pulled through and found Object Relations.

Object Relations or, the relationship between objects, (Classes particularly) gave me a visual representation of the structure of Ruby. I found a video on object structures in Ruby that went over the hierarchy of objects that led to me being able to think about how a given object in the real world might be using other objects or processes unseen to accomplish its task. The possibilities seem endless with what can be accomplished using Object Orientation and the way I can now visualize what I might need to make an object work. Don't get me wrong, I still require lots of coffee, YouTube and head-scratching but now that I can think about the process and relationships between objects I'm feeling much more confident in being a programmer.
