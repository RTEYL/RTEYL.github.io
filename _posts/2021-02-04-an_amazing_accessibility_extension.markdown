The [Siteimprove Accessibility Checker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/siteimprove-accessibility/efcfolpjihicnikpmhnmphjhhpiclljc) extension is free on google chrome and is extremely easy to use and navigate. Each category of issues checked offers tons of information and links to WCAG documentation.

This extension also provides context and user scenarios to help you implement best practices in the future. It works directly in browser and points to the specific element in chromes dev tools as well as highlighting focus points on the web page itself.

The biggest surprise I found was it's color contrast tool. It will highlight text areas plus show the text color and the background color in hexadecimal / rgb format. I found it incredibly easy to do search through my files by the specific color and play around with the contrast.
